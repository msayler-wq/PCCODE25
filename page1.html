        <p>-Countries with large populations (i.e. China and India) saw CO2 emissions rise over time. China had the largest increase, starting from 3.4B tons of CO2 emissions in 2000 and ending with 10.26B tons of emissons in 2024.</p>

<p>Total industrial water consumption and CO2 emissions don't appear to be directly correlated; however, China did significantly decrease in industrial water consumption while CO2 emissions between 2000-2015.</p>

<p>Between 2000 and 2005, many countries shifted back down to lower industrial water consumption values. CO2 emissions during this time generally fluctuated without a clear trend for all the countries.</p>

        <p>-The US has had significantly more extreme weather events than any other country (nearly double of some countries) and has a mid-range amount of rainfall in mm.</p>

<p>It seems that more extreme weather events doesn't directly correlate with more rainfall since the US, which has the most extreme weather events, received only 790 mm of rainfall when a country like Indonesia received 2715 mm of rainfall despite having roughly half of the US's extreme weather event occurences.</p>

<p>It seems that countries relatively close to the equator receive the most rainfall, with the exception of the United Kingdom, which received a high amount of rainfall but is not relatively close to the equator.</p>

        <p>It doesn't seem as though there is a clear trend between GDP and industrial water consumption. However, when looking at a large country like China, it seems that as GDP initially increases from 2005-2015, the total industrial water consumption decreases. However, in the years after 2015, both the GDP and total industrial water consumption fluctuate without a clear trend.</p>

<p>In the years 2020 and 2024, it seems that both China and India are using roughly the same amount of water for industrial purposes (around 127B m^3) despite China having a relatively larger GDP than India for these years.</p>

<p>Unsually, the US's GDP increased in the year 2020 and the total industrial water usage amount decreased from 2015, despite the COVID-19 pandemic occurring around this time.</p>

        <p>-After recessive periods began, the range of per capita water usage globally narrowed, with absolute minima rising and absolute maxima falling from 2008-2009 (2008 financial crisis) and 2020-2021 (COVID-19 pandemic).</p>

<p>The highest per capita water usage occured in India in the year 2000, with the amount being 404.35 L per day. It makes sense for the per capita water usage value to be high in a very populated country like India, however, we would normally expect the high to occur in a more recent year when population has increased significantly.</p>

<p>The US had a very significant drop in per capita water usage from 2009-2010, with the numbers dropping from 291.4511 L/day to 193.34 L/day (nearly a 100 L decrease).</p>

<p>Both India and Italy's per capita water usage amounts barely change from 2014-2015, with the values being around 234 L/day and 299 L/day (respectively). India and Italy's per capita water usage amounts also seemed to increase and decrease alongside each other for the years 2000-2008. Their per capita water usage amounts are also quite similar to each other for the years 2000 and 2024, with both India and Italy's per capita water usage amount being around 400 L/day (for 2000) and 330 L/day (for 2024).</p>

<p>It appears that there is an initial increase in both GDP and industrial water consumption for the US for the years 2006-2010. However, the following years show a decline in GDP with a continued increase in industrail water consumption. This could be due to the boom of technology that occurred in these years, which would increase the US's GDP but decrease industrial water usage since most technology advances before the recent increase in data center use don't consume water.</p>

<p>From around 2020-2024, it looks like the GDP and industrial water consumption amounts are mirror images of each other, with them both having roughly the same slopes but diverging in opposite directions (as GDP increases linearly, industrial water consumption decreases linearly at roughly the same rate as GDP increases). This is likely due to the technology boom during these years.</p>

<p>The largest industrial water consumption amount for the US occurred in 2010, with the amount being 153.18B m^3. This could have been caused by a rebound from the 2009 recession that took place in the US.</p>
