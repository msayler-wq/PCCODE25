        <h1>Global Water Usage Data Mapped by Country</h1>
        <embed src="chloropleth_total_water_usage_by_country.html"
          type="text/html" height="840" width="1200" />
        <p>Surprisingly, in 2024, the US hit its lowest total water consumption amount at 249.485 billion m^3 (it came close to this in 2013 at 318.79 billion m^3). This is quite low compared to most years, in which around 400-600 billion m^3 of water were consumed.</p>

        <p>Water consumption in the US hit its high in 2009 at 743.671 billion m^3.</p>

        <p>Water consumption in the US fluctuates between mid 400 billion m^3 to early 600 billion m^3.</p>

        <p>China, Japan, and South Korea all have a very similar total water consumption trend, with Japan and South Korea's trend matching the most. China's total water consumption trend matches with the other two countries, but is understandably inflated due to having a larger population.</p>

<p>For being a relatively small country (compared to the other countries on the choropleth), Germany used a lot of water in 2003 (727.987 billion m^3). This is especially odd, as a drought and water shortage on the Rhine River occurred in Germany in 2003.</p>
        <embed src="./chloropleth_per_capita (1).html"
          type="text/html" height="840" width="1200" />
        <p>Russia and South Africa's water usage per capita remains relatively constant throughout time, being around 200-300 billion m^3 every year.</p>

<p>Water usage amount per capita in the US did not peak in 2009, despite having its greatest total water usage in 2009.</p>

<p>In 2024, the US had the lowest water usage amount per capita, consuming 186.374 billion m^3. This is consistent with visualization 2, which shows that the US used the least amount of water total in 2024.</p>
        <embed src="./industrial_water_chloropleth.html"
          type="text/html" height="840" width="1200" />
        <p>-In 2006, Canada had the highest industrial water usage percent, with 43.58% of its total water use being for industrial purposes.</p>

<p>The US consistently used around 20-30% of its water consumption for industrial use throughout the years.</p>

<p>Russia had an outlier of 38.757% of industrial water usage in the year 2007, despite typically having lower industrial water usage percents for previous and future years.</p>
        <embed src="./agricultural_water_chloropleth.html"
          type="text/html" height="840" width="1200" />
        <p>-Argentina in 2020 has the highest agricultural water usage percent (66.52%) out of all the countries in all the years. This is likely due to a boom in agriculture this year for Argentina or a boom in rainfall.</p>

<p>During the COVID-19 years (2019-2021), the US's agricultural water usage percent remained nearly constant, at around 46% for all three years.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, the US didn't have an agricultural water usage record high in 2022, despite further research indicating 2022 to be the most profitable year in agriculture for the US. However, its largest agricultural water usage percent occurred in 2023 (a year after its most agriculturally profitable year), with the percentage being 62.945%. This could be because the US is attempting to replicate the agricultural profits of the prior year, thus causing the country to use more water for agriculture.</p>
        <h2>Compare Trends in Water Usage Between Countries</h2>
        <embed src="./linechart.html"
          type="text/html" height="840" width="1200" />
        <p>-According to the extreme weather events and rainfall visualization, in 2024 Indonesia had the most rainfall out of all the countries. Despite having more rainfall than the other countries though, from this visualization it doesn't seem that Indonesia uses significantly more water than the other countries in 2024.</p>

<p>In 2024, Argentina used the most water out of all the countries, with a usage amount of 647.79B m^3 of water.</p>

<p>The most water used by any of the countries from 2000-2024 was 798.418B m^3 by China in 2004. This is odd however since we would expect the most water to be used in a more recent year when population has increased.</p>

<p>The lowest amount of water used by any country during this period is 129.6367B m^3 of water by Germany in 2009. This makes some sense since further research indicates that Germany had a financial crisis in 2009 that caused a recession, and as seen in the following per capita water usage visualization, water consumption decreased after recessive periods.</p>
<p>China, Japan, and South Korea all have a very similar total water consumption trend, with Japan and South Korea's trend matching the most. China's total water consumption trend matches with the other two countries, but is understandably inflated due to having a larger population. The similarity in water usage of these countries makes sense, since they are all located relatively close to each other geographically.</p>
